# Skype call 17.12.19

- Call with Africas Voices Team (when?)
- Luke going to Nairobi on 6th Jan

- Looking at each slides for 10-20 seconds

- Display messages - parameters: topic similarity, co-occurence of topics, patterns of linguistic

- “Really good, exactly what I was looking for”

- How difficult?
- First wave was easy, but now might be harder because we are already influenced
- Set constraints: only focus on bar charts or graphs
- Suggestions: take step back from diagrams we were producing
- Different types of diagrams
- taxonomy: Proximity, animations

- Design thinking exercise: categorise, visual variables, tag ‘em,
- Design diagrams in space where we didn’t have enough ideas yet
- continue until 75 - 100, over the break
- Do design work independently and then come back again and put everything together

- Useful to communicate “novel” ideas to others, produce higher resolution, better sketches
- Storyboard for animation or interaction

- Next challenge: more ideas, higher quality rendering for archive purposes (he will send suggestions for which diagrams to do that)
- Prototype one diagram, how many hours is it going to take? Probably dependent on diagram type
- Library where it is as easy to produce novel diagrams as it is to produce ordinary diagrams

- As long as the prototype is meaningful, we do not need to use the real data, we may use dummy data for the start

- Visualisation for large scale patterns -> needs whole data set
- Constructive, rational narrative -> may take small synthesised data set
- Or if it does not make a substantial difference

- Keep questions and visualisation in head, not actively spend hours on the task (opportunistic thinking) take notebook with you

- Sending list with parameters, Luke will have a look at it, also add parameters from other projects 
- [x] Possible meeting slots for week of 6th of January
