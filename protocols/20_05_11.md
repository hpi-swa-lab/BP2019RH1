### Coming to an end
Luke wants to help with press release and poster
we should give Luke key arguments as bullet points so that he can review it
-> press release translate

### Options

#### Luke
strike: F, E, D (not super interesting as our project is research not product engineering), 
love: C
less interested: B.2
nice to have: A (tweaking)
no real comment: B

Conclusion for us: focus on C and tweak all in one.
Do not integrate other prototypes

fantastic paper: rational design processes why they are impossible and why you should fake it

Goal of project: user interaction for visualizations as validation
Detailed feedback of Luke / or actual user testing with researcher
Not in between
-> maximize insights / design validation in coming weeks

#### Jens

keep graph like structure -> get rid of ui elements
preserve overview and keep them on one page

### Questions
Theresa: Integrate other prototypes?
Answer: How i want to bring this project further -> maximum learning now, get learnings to a production engineering
two learnings are important to him:
1. Take visualisation and user interaction design developed by us and take it to production engineers (so our task is to research and brainstorm) or
2. Take something that is sufficient enough to be tested and then tell engineers 
Everything in between is less important

Theresa: Regarding panes, user interaction or software design
Answer: UI interaction design, think about: collapsing, combining

-> meeting to go through the code -> 

Theresa: how about windows?
Answer (Jens): should use windows inside a markdown page

Full screen mode -> large display (2xA3) is our real estate
Ask for every feature, how is its size and this going to support exploration and how narrative. 

Leo: where to go with evaluation
when Luke said that this something interesting 
Hypothesis: its not possible to create new visualization
Evaluate on broader view not on detailed interaction
outcomes are a form of evaluation in itself.
