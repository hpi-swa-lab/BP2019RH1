# 25.03.2020 - FG-Presentation

First prototype (Theresa):

- Making selection more visible
- Magnifying glass for mouse
- Stack points because distribution (random) funny
- Clarify the situation of the districts (by stacking the points
- better arrange the districts (according to geographical proximity, numerical value)

Activate y-axis:

- Color legend missing
- Colours lead to confusion

Fabio:

- Point as Object
- Point that can be programmed by the user
- force-graph
    - attract or repel each other, colour, depending on the metrics set by the user

Stefan:

- at first everything random is not so cool
- prefer to set default rather than random order
- pca
    - principle component analysis

Marcel:

- make randomness more obvious (fidget or something)
- Aggregation, Transfer many points to a new point
- With card it disturbs even more
- regular arrangement on the card

Hirschfeld:

- Select a point, highlight all similar ones
- DECISION, WE WANT TO MAKE A DECISION WITH THE DATA
- USE CASES, WE NEED USE CASES

Patrick:

- Move, because these are people

Jens:

- show speech bubbles when zooming in, show qualitative data even without previous selection

Tom:

- make statistical significance visible (and calculate, lol)
