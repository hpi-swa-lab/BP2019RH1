# 24.03.2020 - Call with Luke

- Theresa gives update
    - working fulltime
    - research

- Prototype presenting
- Theresas prototype
    - filter-points-with-real-data
    
- Simon and Moes prototype
    - grouping
    - "awesome"
- Luc and Laras prototype
    - activate y-axis
    - "awesome"

- Zwischen Feedback
    - categorical grouping
    - not ordered for themes by now
        - Luke will give us lables for messages
        - Luke will present us the dataset (coronavirus kenya)
        - Luke will give us the dataset

- Laras prototype
    - multiple-diagrams-individuals
    - Luke
        - group by themes would be much more interesting
        
- Theresas prototype
    - theme-centered
    - Luke
        - "this is interesting"
        - "awesome"
        
- Theresas prototype
    - the same with demographic data

- Wandas prototype
    - dot-density-map-with-selection
    - Luke
        - "interesting"
        - false density in Mogadishu, how to do that?
        - two maps side on side for more details (two views)

- Laras prototype
    - dot-density-map-with-zoom
    - Luke
        - zoom back in to Mogadishu
        - important to explain accuracy of points
        - points are rendered as a grid in the region, this needs to be considered
        - try to make the visualization more obvious wrong when we want to show that this is not the actual position of points

- Lucs prototype
    - display-exploration
    - Luke
        - "fantastic"

- Luke
    - no, not the direction he imagined, but thats what he wanted
    - great direction
    - choice
        - integrated visualization system
        - or number of different interactions, exploring technics
        - question: what would it take to embed all the prototypes into one integrated system?
    - panel-view as basic workflow for all the prototypes we've had
    - try to find out what it takes to build a integrated systems

    - luke has dataset that we should visualize
    - we will do that (Jens and Hirschfeld)
    - he will send that data
    - we send links to visualization

- Jens
    - exploration path is better than integrated system
    - prefer to spread out
    - look again which visualizations we had painted in the beginning and re-iterate

- Hirschfeld
    - Which questions can be asked about visualizations?
    - from the user's point of view better define how he should handle the visualization, how he can ask questions that can be answered with the visualization, explore
