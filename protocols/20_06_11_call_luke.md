# press release

## partners

- just some example ones from the website
  - UNICEF

- other UN agencies are probably not known good enough

## suggestions

- better is a better word than "more precise"
- more useful could work but then again how would you prove that?
- prefer decision makers over politicians
- international English? Should we re-write it?

# presentation

- the English wasn't bad at all
- likes the visual style

### quote

- if we don't want to upset our audience we should pick a quote that they can deal with
- three types of quotes
  - to show what the data is: a single quote that the audience can deal with
  - to make them think about other background: something slightly controversial, but not that much
- connect the quote more to the explanation
- picking something were we can explain what we could see from the quote. With the Allah quote it's just "so what? How should I deal with it?"
- "ginger, black tea, pepper and lemon" could be an option
- people think Somalia is a different world -> choose a quote that shows them, it's not that different, they have do deal with similar problems

### qualitative and quantitative data

- just saying that you can think about data in two different ways
- split between quant and qual is okay
- we need to change the qualitative data to a quote and add a theme to it to make clear that it is something other than a number

### live demo (screen cast)

- be careful with what we're showing
- Luke needs some more time for input
- he will play with the tool a bit to get some context
- wonder whether we could synthesize some examples of the existing Somalia presentation because they are already thought-through

# panes

## people drawing

- don't animate it, that is just visually distracting
- drawings have the tendency to reduce people to stock images
- lot of culture problems with the drawings
  - lady does not look Somalian
  - they have to look different although in different demographic groups
  - who ware we to decide how a black person looks like?
  - take the tool and talk with about context we want to use it. Ask them: how would you want to be displayed? -> tedious
- just try another prototype. It is quite difficult to make good

- make screen shot of it (as well as of all other prototypes)
