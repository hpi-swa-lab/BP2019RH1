Some infographics suggestions to think about online:

Lines describing the journeys of several refugees from their home town to a refugee centre in Vercelli, Italy. Some lines have more written stories than others, but I like the minimalism of the design, and being able to follow their route with some stories about each place.

A visualisation/data art that has a lot of complexity in, and invites close reading. Explanation for how to read it towards the end. In general, I quite like Giorgia Lupi's style, I came across her Dear Data project (with Stefanie Posavec), it's a nice browse. The visualisation for week 20 (the one on the left with the newspaper cutouts) seems like it would be quite interesting for your infographic - you could use a different texture style for quotes, or even make the quotes the central thing instead of the charts, and have tiny charts around the quote. Maybe instead of newspaper cutouts you could have a design that imitates an SMS message speech cloud.

A fairly straightforward interactive visualisation, combining quantitative charts and tweets. A bit of a shame that the charts are not interactive, it would have been nice to be able to hover over one of the little squares in the graphics and see a sample tweet.

Biology-style illustrations
Using an expanding cone to zoom in on something, and "dive deep", could be done interactive or static.

Website with charts. Has some quotes alongside the charts, but they seem less important, but they could be brought to the forefront a bit more.

What would it take to implement these? :-)

Specifically, we thought a bit about how we might adapt the visualisation from Musk at AVF. Please find attached a slight deck of some initial thinking we did about it.

In the call I also mentioned the books on visualisation by Alberto Cairo:

I'll get you a data protection agreement before the end of the day tomorrow. For now you can think of the data as being a data-structure of things that look lots of these:

Anonymous-ID: (GUID)
