# RawGraphs


## Context
  
  - What is it about?
    - create custom vector-based visualizations on top of the amazing d3.js library
    - tool for designers and vis geeks, RAW aims at providing a missing link between spreadsheet applications and vector graphics editors 
    - works with delimiter-separated values (i.e. csv and tsv files) as well as with copied-and-pasted texts from other applications
    - data is processed only by the web browser: no server-side operation or storage are performed - no one will see, touch or copy your data!
    - highly customizable and extensible, accepting new custom charts defined by users
