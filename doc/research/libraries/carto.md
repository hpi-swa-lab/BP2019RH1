## Experience
- support: <https://carto.com/developers/carto-js/support/support-options/>
- detailed documentation: <https://carto.com/developers/carto-js/guides/overview/>
- I experimented a bit with examples and it creates the feeling of not being very intuitive. It would need a closer reading to completely understand how to create maps with this library
