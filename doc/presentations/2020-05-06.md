# Context

**Our Goal:** Create explorable visualizations for

<div align="center"><img src="pictures/africas-voices-logo-pad.svg" alt="drawing" width="400"/></div>

Africa's Voices **collects opinions** of citizens by making a radio show and receiving SMSs as answers.

They use the data to **inform** policy makers.

## How did we approach this goal over the last months?

In **January** we tried to understand the data.

In **January** and **February** we brainstormed a lot and designed many new visualizations.

In **March** we researched on how to display points and started working on our first prototypes.

In **April** we worked on prototypes and integrating them into one system.

# What happened since last time?

## Covid-19
- new procedures within AVF (one-to-one conversations)
- new data sets for Somalia and Kenya
- weekly calls with Luke, more user testing, more feedback
- he might even show it to researchers

So we integrated a lot of feedback and started improving old and coming up with new prototypes.
We also worked on a system that could connect all prototypes together in one application.

# Scenario

We want to find out whether:
- something related to demographics and themes
- something geographical (rural / urban contrast maybe?)
- urban males are more interested in govt than ???
