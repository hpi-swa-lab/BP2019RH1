# What is our project about again?
<div align="center"><img src="pictures/africas-voices-logo-pad.svg" alt="drawing" width="400"/></div>

- Get **public opinion** polls where getting representative data from citizens is hard 
- People responding with SMS to questions asked on radio show
- Africa's Voices:
  - compiles, translates and aggregates responses
  - uses that data to **inform policy makers**
- And we?
  - **generate visualizations** that can help understand and 
    **explore** the obtained qualitative data

# We had a visit
- Week before last week Luke (our project partner) visited the Fachgebiet

# What we thought our goals were going to be


### Africa's Voices Researcher
Goal => Help to ease their process
1. Generate diagrams automatically.
2. Generate explorable diagrams.
3. Generate explorable diagrams to answer emerging questions.

### Africa's Voices Policy maker
Goal => Provide valuable information for decision making 
![](pictures/stakeholder_av.png){ style="float:right" alt="drawing" width="280"}
1. Build a tool to show data to policy makers.
2. Explore with policy maker / let policy maker explore.
3. Answer questions that emerge during exploration.

# What we think our goals are going to be now

0. **Understand** provided data / domain 
1. **Brainstorm** / Design visualizations (a lot of them)
  - Unconventional
  - Explorable
  - Individual-centered
  - No completeness of data
2. **Implement** the best ideas

(3. Synthesize similarities into a framework)

---

# We have data

- Data privacy agreement
- Two files in JSON format
  - Messages (1.2 GB)
  - Individuals (1 GB) 
- Each line in data files represents an individual/message => provenance
- Nested structure to show merge with other tracedata
- Objects contain:
  - raw data (responses and personal information)
  - coding of responses
  - processing metadata
