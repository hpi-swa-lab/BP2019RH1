Keep on going as before\n### Option A:\n\nKeep improving All-in-One with remaining feedback\n\n### Option B:\n\nSpike new prototypes\n\n### Option B.2:\n\nBuild in standard visualizations like (stacked/multidimensional) bar charts, sankey diagram, bundle view\n\n---\n# 2. Pick up some old ideas and try something new\n### Option C:\n\nBuild a window architecture (going back to the pane prototype) to use visualizations independently of each other but with shared state\n\n![](./pictures/pane-prototype.jpeg){height=\"260\", style=\"float:right\"}\n### Option D:\n\nWork on a solution to keep state persistent\n\n### Option E:\n\nImprove stability and loading time of All-in-One (and everything component based)\n\n### Option F:\n\nWork on a solution for you to input your own data\n\n---\n# Explaining Option B: Ideas for new prototypes\n\n- Sankey diagram\n- 3D graph that connects individuals to themes \n- Experiment with fake messages\n- [Mindmap storyboard](https://lively-kernel.org/lively4/BP2019RH1/doc/visualizations/storyboards/mindmap.md)\n- Bar charts\n\nInteractions:\n- Highlight similar individuals\n- Lasso selection / filtering\n"}
