-> alles in Topf


Wie bedienen wir diese Stakeholder / Was möchten die Stakeholder?

Mapping between Data & Visualization
    
Fachgebiet: Möchte uns researchen sehen mit exploring responsible code throwing colorbags in data streams 
Mapping between Visualisation & Code -> Nachvollziehbarkeit wann wo , wie Daten verändert und zur visualisierung werden
Tool für Leute die Programmieren

African Voices: 
Goals with this project: 
- Researcher:
  - Goals: Help in work process 
      - easy generation of visualizations
      - explorable visualizations to find new (unforeseen) connections 
          - usually you do visualizations with a specific questions in mind 
  - 1. Step: Automatically generate digrams out of data (excel so far) -> Make day to day work easier
  - 2. Step: Generate explorable visualizations (back and forth between original data and "pixels in graphic") to make it easier to find interesting connections / eventually trends 
  - 3. Step: Answer questions emerging after visualization 
  - additionally perhaps support in machine learning process: Find out what kind of messages people did disagree on with machines ? Support human "labelers" with showing them "suprisingly" labeled messages  
- Politicians a.k.a. Policy makers
  - Goals: Provide policy makers with valuable information
    - Find out what life is really like
    - Emotionally connectable
  - 1. Step: Within workshop context, show policy makers data / information with tool
  - 2. Step: Be able to share tool with policy makers -> usable for policy makers who have no experience with data analysis / programming (end user tool)
  - Ideally:  Together with policy makers answer questions emerging after presentation / visualization




Wir:  - haben Spaß, lernen Datenvisualisierungsbasics / Einblick in research, bekommen unseren Bachelor
