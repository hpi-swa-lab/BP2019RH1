# Glossary

Our project has many terms that need further definition or explanation. Therefore this document contains the relevant terms.

## AVF

The _Africa's Voices Foundation_, our project partner represented by Luke Church. They cooperate with local radio stations to get meaningful insights from citizens. Their home page can be found here: [https://www.africasvoices.org/](https://www.africasvoices.org/)

## Farbe ins Wasser werfen

Let's say we got a blackbox. We can give it some input and get some output. "Farbe ins Wasser werfen" is a way to track the correlation between the input and output of the blackbox. The idea comes from the analysis of water streams. If you do not know, how the stream works, just throw some color in it and look where it comes out. 

In our case that is a way to get the data point behind the visual representation. One way is to render the image twice: once where every data point is represented with a unique color and once with the color that makes sense for the visualization. The picture with the unique colors get saved so that interaction works with that and not the visible one. By using the unique color, the data point can then be found easily.

## IDP

IDP stands for _Internally Displaced People_. An internally displaced person is someone who is forced to flee his or her home but remains in his or her country's borders. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person)

## Radio Show

In cooperation with local radio stations, the AVF makes radio shows on certain topics. During the show, questions are proposed to the audience in order to find out why things are the way the are or how it could be better. People can answer to these questions via SMS. The SMS' get handled by RapidPro and sometimes are used in the radio show to further discuss about the topic.

## Rapid Pro

_"RapidPro is an Open Source platform that allows anyone to build interactive messaging systems using an easy visual interface"_ ([https://rapidpro.github.io/rapidpro/](https://rapidpro.github.io/rapidpro/), last access: 10.03.2020 09:34am GMT+1). 

RapidPro allows to create what they call a RapidPro Flow. It starts by sending a message/question via a messenger or SMS to all registered recipients. Depending on the recipients answer a new message/question. The message flow that is generated by that gets stored and is usable later on. RapidPro made an explanation video which can be found here: [https://youtu.be/WcFhpSFhFug](https://youtu.be/WcFhpSFhFug).

## Theme

When people answers to a question in a radio show, that answer contains the opinion of the person answering. This opinion usually can be put in categories like "access to water" or "education". These categories are what we call _themes_.
