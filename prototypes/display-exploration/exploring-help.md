## Exploring History

In Each pane you can do one operation:
- coloring the individuals by a selected attribute OR
- filter (in) the individuals by a selected attribute and value OR
- group the individuals on the x axis by a selected attribute

With panes you can:
- add multiple "initial panes" which get the unprocessed data
- add multiple child panes which operate on the data they get out of the parent pane
- delete a pane and all its successors

By adding multiple children to a pane a decision tree is formed which later can be revised (is lively does not get closed) to see which decisions led to the resulting diagram.
