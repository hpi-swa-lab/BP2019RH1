## Individuals on a Map

Please note: individuals that stated a constituency but not a county are not yet mapped to a county and will appear in the "missing" box.

You can: 
- hover over a county to display some information on the right.
- select an individual to show its attribute values on the right. 
- select an attribute in the menu on the right to color the individuals corresponding to their values of this attribute.
- select "themes" as an attribute and then select one or multiple themes with "Shift" + Click or "Strg" + Click. This will highlight all individuals that talked about all of those themes.
- select a country on the right to display a different data set.
