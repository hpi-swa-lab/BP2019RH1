## Prototypes

- ?[movement](https://lively-kernel.org/lively4/BP2019RH1/scratch/movement/index.md): "Movement" is a prototype that displays themes as bubbles and lets the individuals as dots move between them depending on the categorized themes.
  
- ?[forces](https://lively-kernel.org/lively4/BP2019RH1/scratch/forces/index.md): "Forces" is a prototype in its early stages that works with forces to display similarities and differences between individuals.

- [3d-graph](https://lively-kernel.org/lively4/BP2019RH1/scratch/3d-graph/index.md): This was an experiment on displaying the individuals in a 3d graph.

## Spikes
  
- [firstTries](https://lively-kernel.org/lively4/BP2019RH1/scratch/firstTries/index.md): In the first weeks we tried to get to know Lively4 and to gain experience in programming visualizations. This directory contains all experimental first tries. 
- [BubbleChartSource](https://lively-kernel.org/lively4/BP2019RH1/scratch/BubbleChartSource/index.md): This is the source directory for the [bubble chart](https://lively-kernel.org/lively4/BP2019RH1/scratch/firstTries/bubbleChart.md) we created as part of our first tries at the beginning of our project. 
- [drawFreehand](https://lively-kernel.org/lively4/BP2019RH1/scratch/drawFreehand/index.md): As a selection interaction we wanted to implement a lasso select. This directory includes is a spike regarding this interaction.
- [individualsAsPoints](https://lively-kernel.org/lively4/BP2019RH1/scratch/individualsAsPoints/index.md): This directory includes experiments with different technologies to display individuals as dots and spikes regarding some interactions with the data.
- [smallSpikes](https://lively-kernel.org/lively4/BP2019RH1/scratch/smallSpikes/index.md): This directory includes different small spikes regarding various concepts, e.g. zooming, menu interaction, etc.
- ?[animation](https://lively-kernel.org/lively4/BP2019RH1/scratch/animation-test/animation-test.md.md)
