## AVF Parser 

The data objects we received from the Africa's Voices Foundation are very large. They are too big to load them into a browser. That's why we adapted our data server to deliver compressed data. To access that, we provided the AVFParser. 

Documentation for the AVFParser can be found here: <https://lively-kernel.org/voices/parsing-data/parsing.md>
